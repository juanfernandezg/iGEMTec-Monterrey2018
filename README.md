# iGEMTec-Monterrey2018
In this repository, the codes developed during the iGEM 2018 competition as well as the final codes are available
Final codes conatins all the MATLAB functions and scripts ready to run. The experimental data recollected, used for the parametrization of the protein production is contained in the data.mat files. The best-fit parameters are in kRT.mat (for reverse transcriptase production), and in kWT.mat (for Cas wild type production).
